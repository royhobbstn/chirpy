# Chirpy

*"A chirp is quieter than a tweet."*

A free, minimal, information-focused Twitter client.

Only display *"chirps"* with outside links.  No inane banter.  No moral outrage.  No endless scrolling.  Just the nutrients.

Chirpy dutifully delivers a limited selection of info-link-worms and you will eat them because it's what you've been given.</sub>
